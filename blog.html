        <h2>01 SCARED LITTLE BABY DISEASE</h2>
        <p>We feel losses way harder than gains, think 2x the gut punch. It's why I didn't sell glencore plc to realize my loss, even though I would no longer buy it, and it's part of the reason why young Nikolaj chose preserving a little self-esteem, rather than potentially gaining huge self-esteem by talking to girls at BARKOWSI. Smart people like Kahneman and Tversky call this loss aversion.

        <h2>02 LOOK OVER HERE</h2>
        <p>Words are sneaky bastards. "Cocio, now 50% less sugar" sounds hell of a lot better than, "Cocio, now only 50% sugar". Kahneman and Tversky proved we’ll pick surgery with a “90% survival rate” over “10% death rate,” all day long, even though it’s the same damn thing. They call ir the framing effect.</p>

        <h2>03 MY STUFF BETTER THAN NOT MY STUFF</h2>
        <p>My junk is my treasure. I refused to sell my old bike for 1500, even though I wouldn’t pay 500 for it on marketplace. Richard Thaler showed owners demand more to sell than they’d pay to buy. He calls it the endowment effect. Lesson: Your stuff isn’t that special. Let it go.</p>

        <h2>04 ANCHORING BIAS</h2>
        <p>The first number screws you. Normal cars are sold at dealerships, where you compare different cars at different prices. It's apples to apples. Rolls-Royce sell their cars at yacht shows, where after looking at multimillion dollar yachts all day, it suddenly doesn't seem so expensive to pay 500k for a lovely car. In everyday life this psycological phenomena might be me overpaying for an airfryer on black friday, because the tag says "before 1200, now 800". That does not mean i will get 1200 of value from it, and it does not mean it's worth 1200 or even 800 on the open market. <br>My grandpa got this one right. He used to say "it's cheap if it's worth more". And that's the key, look at utility</p>

        <h2>05 SUNK COST FALLACY</h2>
        <p>Throwing good money after bad. I stuck with a shady sales job because I’d already put in months. That’s sunk cost fallacy—doubling down on losses. Thaler says we hate wasting past effort. It’s why people stay in dead-end relationships. Lesson: Past costs are gone. Focus on what’s next.</p>

        <h2>06 PRESENT BIAS</h2>
        <p>Gimme now, screw tomorrow. I blew savings on a leather jacket instead of rent. That’s present bias—instant gratification over future gains. Laibson showed we’d take $100 today over $125 in a year. Lesson: Trick yourself into saving, automate decisions so your future self doesn’t hate you.</p>

        <h2>07 STATUS QUO BIAS</h2>
        <p>Change is for suckers. Ever stick with a crappy phone plan because switching feels like a hassle? That’s status quo bias. Madrian showed default 401(k) opt-outs skyrocket enrollment. We resist change from fear or laziness. Lesson: Staying stuck is worse than switching. Rip the Band-Aid off.</p>

        <h2>08 OVERCONFIDENCE BIAS</h2>
        <p>I’m a freaking genius (spoiler: I’m not). I thought I could nail a pitch with zero prep. Crashed and burned. Gruber says 80% of drivers think they’re above average (impossible!). Overconfidence blinds us to risk. Lesson: Humble up, plan better, and assume you’re wrong sometimes.</p>
