        <h2>01 THIS IS MY TOY!</h2>
        <p>We’re scared little babies about losing stuff. This is more formaly known as loss aversion. We feel losses way harder than gains, think 2x the gut punch. I once held onto a crypto coin that tanked because selling felt like admitting defeat. Kahneman and Tversky showed we’d rather gamble than cut losses. Lesson: Cut the cord, dude.</p>

        <h2>02 FRAMING EFFECT</h2>
        <p>Words are sneaky bastards. “75% fat-free” yogurt sounds like health food, but “25% fat” sounds like a heart attack. Kahneman and Tversky proved we’ll pick surgery with a “90% survival rate” over “10% death rate,” even though it’s identical. Lesson: Read the fine print, ignore the hype.</p>

        <h2>03 ENDOWMENT EFFECT</h2>
        <p>My junk is my treasure. I refused to sell an old skateboard for $50 because it was mine, but I wouldn’t pay $20 for it on eBay. Richard Thaler showed owners demand more to sell than they’d pay to buy. Lesson: Your stuff isn’t that special. Let it go.</p>

        <h2>04 ANCHORING BIAS</h2>
        <p>The first number screws you. I overpaid for a laptop because the tag said “was $1200, now $800.” Felt like a deal, but worth maybe $600. Even random numbers can anchor our guesses. Lesson: Ignore the first number, it’s a mental trap designed to mess with you. <br>My grandpa got this one right. He used to say "it's cheap if it's worth more". And that's the key, look at utility</p>

        <h2>05 SUNK COST FALLACY</h2>
        <p>Throwing good money after bad. I stuck with a shady sales job because I’d already put in months. That’s sunk cost fallacy—doubling down on losses. Thaler says we hate wasting past effort. It’s why people stay in dead-end relationships. Lesson: Past costs are gone. Focus on what’s next.</p>

        <h2>06 PRESENT BIAS</h2>
        <p>Gimme now, screw tomorrow. I blew savings on a leather jacket instead of rent. That’s present bias—instant gratification over future gains. Laibson showed we’d take $100 today over $125 in a year. Lesson: Trick yourself into saving, automate decisions so your future self doesn’t hate you.</p>

        <h2>07 STATUS QUO BIAS</h2>
        <p>Change is for suckers. Ever stick with a crappy phone plan because switching feels like a hassle? That’s status quo bias. Madrian showed default 401(k) opt-outs skyrocket enrollment. We resist change from fear or laziness. Lesson: Staying stuck is worse than switching. Rip the Band-Aid off.</p>

        <h2>08 OVERCONFIDENCE BIAS</h2>
        <p>I’m a freaking genius (spoiler: I’m not). I thought I could nail a pitch with zero prep. Crashed and burned. Gruber says 80% of drivers think they’re above average (impossible!). Overconfidence blinds us to risk. Lesson: Humble up, plan better, and assume you’re wrong sometimes.</p>
